# WebNovel-Scanner

I was writing an essay on a webnovel that I was reading, and I was trying to find quotations to use for my writing, but it was hard to find my quotations because the text was split up between different chapters on different links. I wanted to put all the text on one file so that way I could easily use (ctrl+f) to find certain quotations. I created this python script which converts the txt file of chapter names into links, scrapes all the text from the link, and then pastes it into the c1.txt file and does so for every chapter that I read.
